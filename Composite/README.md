#Composite

This design pattern gives a way to treat a bunch of objects as if they were all one instance.
It enforces behaviour for this group of objects that is the same, even if the objects are of different types.

##When to Use It

1. When a part of a relationship tree needs to represented similar to the whole tree
2. When clients can ignore the differences between the composition of objects and individual objects
3. When the structure can have any level of complexity and is dynamic

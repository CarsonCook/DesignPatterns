#Adaptor

Also known as a wrapper, this pattern it used to make one class compatible with another, that otherwise would not
be compatible.

##When to Use It

1. When the existing class has an interface that doesn't match the client's needs
2. When a created class isn't compatible with another, unrelated class
3. When the transparency of a class is needed

##Benefits

1. makes a class highly reusable
2. Creates a use kit for a class

##Drawbacks

1. In some languages (e.g. Java), the target must be an interface

#Singleton

The singleton design pattern is used to ensure only one object of a given class exists at a time.
This is often used in improper situations, causing more problems in the program than it solves, due to tight coupling.

##When to Use It

1. When only a specific number of instances of a class are needed
2. When a facade is needed - often only one is needed

##Drawbacks

1. Can be overused and cause unnecessary limitations

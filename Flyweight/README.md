#Flyweight

The flyweight pattern is used to limit memory usage and computational expense. Similar objects share as much
as they can in order to minimize these factors.

##Where to Use It

1. When the objects needed won't fit in the given memory
2. When the object's state can be stored on disk or caclulated at runtime

##Benefits

1. Number of objects made is reduced
2. Less memory is used and higher performance is the result
